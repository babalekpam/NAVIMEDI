Your deployment attempt had the following errors:
The deployment is failing health checks because Cloud Run is unable to get a successful response from the / endpoint
The root endpoint (/) is trying to serve HTML content but the health check system expects a fast JSON response
The health check detection logic in server/routes.ts may not be correctly identifying Cloud Run health check requests

Health checks are sent to the / endpoint by default
Configure the deployment to use /health endpoint for health checks in the Replit Deployments Configuration tab

Overview
Vulnerability:
Lucky 13
Domain:
navimedi.org
Risk level:
medium
Reference:
CVE-2013-0169
Severity Rating:
CVSS version 2 (2.6/10, LOW)
Systems Affected
Systems using TLS and DTLS protocols with support for cipher block chaining (CBC) mode operations enabled

Description
Lucky 13 is an exploit that takes advantage of timing- and padding-related vulnerabilities within the transport layer security (TLS) and datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols. It’s a type of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack that works by an attacker:

Calculating the difference in processing times between TLS message authentication code (MAC) messages that have one or two bytes of padding.
Using that info to modify the padding in transit and get the server to leak information that leads to plaintext data discovery. Depending on how it's done, Lucky 13 can allow full or partial plaintext compromise of data in transit.
Remediation Info
Disable the use of insecure protocols. Disable support of all versions of SSL and TLS 1.0 and 1.1.
Enable use of the TLS 1.2 protocol as a minimum. Earlier versions of the TLS protocol are vulnerable to Lucky 13. You can do this easily using Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator tool. Simply select your server software, ensure the “Intermediate” configuration is selected, and copy-paste the provided information. To enable TLS 1.3, you’ll need to select the Modern configuration option instead.
SSL Protocol Error
We were unable to complete the scan due to the following response from the server: ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR. This error indicates that your server was not able to support a secure connection on port 443. Typically, this happens when an SSL certificate is incorrectly installed or SSL/TLS is not correctly configured on the server.


Suggested steps:

Ensure the SSL certificate is valid and correctly installed
Review SSL/TLS protocol settings in your server (and CDN, firewall, and/or load balancer if applicable)
Ensure that you're able to load the website in your browser using HTTPS

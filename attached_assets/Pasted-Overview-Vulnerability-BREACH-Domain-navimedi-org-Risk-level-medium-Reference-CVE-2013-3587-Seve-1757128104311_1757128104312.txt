Overview
Vulnerability:
BREACH
Domain:
navimedi.org
Risk level:
medium
Reference:
CVE-2013-3587
Severity Rating:
CVSS version 2 (4.3/10, Medium)
CVSS version 3 (5.9/10, Medium)
Systems Affected
Servers that use HTTP compression (Deflate, GZIP, etc.) and reuse authentication secrets for multiple requests are vulnerable to BREACH.

Description
Browser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext (BREACH) is an HTTP protocol-level compression category of exploits. BREACH is used to steal or modify sensitive data and secrets that are shared in HTTP responses on websites using HTTP compression mechanisms (e.g., Deflate and GZip). This attack method affects multiple versions of the TLS protocol and virtually all cipher suites; it also doesn’t technically require transport layer security compression.

It’s similar to the CRIME exploit in that it involves compressed HTTP data. However, BREACH uses compression to attack HTTP response data instead of HTTP requests (which is what CRIME does).

Remediation Info
The steps for mitigating this vulnerability were outlined by the vulnerability’s discoverers:

Disable HTTP data compression on your server. Disable the use of GZip and/or Deflate, depending on which your server supports.
Separate authentication tokens from user input. You can do this using “input-less servelets and chunked secret separation.”
Implement cross-signing request forgery (CSRF) prevention best practices. Doing this, including using unique CSRF tokens for each request, will help to protect your most vulnerable pages.
Randomize and mask secrets for each request. Randomizing all secrets for each request, or obfuscating using XOR for each request, are additional proposed options to consider.
Implement rate limits. Set a limit for how many requests can be received within a set period to prevent a client IP address from sending excessive requests to your server or web app.

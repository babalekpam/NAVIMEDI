Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
NAMES AND LABELS
Buttons do not have an accessible name
Image elements have [alt] attributes that are redundant text.
These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
BEST PRACTICES
[user-scalable="no"] is used in the <meta name="viewport"> element or the [maximum-scale] attribute is less than 5.
Touch targets do not have sufficient size or spacing.
These items highlight common accessibility best practices.
NAVIGATION
Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order
These are opportunities to improve keyboard navigation in your application.

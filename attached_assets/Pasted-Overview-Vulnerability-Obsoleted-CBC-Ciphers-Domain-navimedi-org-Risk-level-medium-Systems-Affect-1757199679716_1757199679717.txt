Overview
Vulnerability:
Obsoleted CBC Ciphers
Domain:
navimedi.org
Risk level:
medium
Systems Affected
Servers that support all versions of the SSL protocol and TLS versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.

Description
Cipher block chaining (CBC) refers to a mode of operation used in symmetric encryption. Modes of operation relate to how data gets encrypted or decrypted using symmetric ciphers. The CBC mode is one that’s sequential and builds upon previous data blocks, “chaining” each new plaintext block to the preceding ciphertext output block.

The CBC mode of operation is susceptible to padding oracle attacks, which are cyber attacks that target the verifiable padding data used at the end of each ciphertext block. (Padding enables blocks to be consistent in size.) Oracle padding attacks enable attackers to decrypt data without having access to the secret key. It does this by using an oracle, which is a fancy term for a “tell” — i.e., clues, much like the types of facial behavioral indicators beginning poker players have when they have good or bad hands.

Remediation Info
Use SSL/TLS to secure your data in transit. If you haven’t already done so, be sure to install an SSL/TLS certificate on your server. This will enable you to encrypt your data in transit using transport layer security.
Change your server’s supported ciphers to GCM. Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is an authenticated encryption (AE) mode that isn’t susceptible to bit-flipping attacks. Use this in place of CBC mode ciphers.
Apache and NGINX users: Use the Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator tool and select the Intermediate configuration to enable support for TLS 1.2 and 1.3, or Modern for TLS 1.3 alone. Doing this disables old protocols and enables strong GCM-mode ciphers.
Windows server users: Update your cipher suites using Microsoft's TLS registry settings guide. Check out this list of supported cipher suites for different Windows versions.

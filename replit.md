# Healthcare Management Platform

## Overview
NaviMED is a multi-tenant healthcare platform connecting independent pharmacies with hospitals to streamline prescription management, facilitate insurance claims, manage patient records, and enhance communication. It aims to be the leading solution for pharmacy-hospital connectivity, improving efficiency, patient care, and data management securely and compliantly.

## User Preferences
- Simple, everyday language for communication (user is non-technical)
- Focus on functionality testing rather than code details
- Prioritize working features over perfect TypeScript compliance
- Super admin account: abel@argilette.com with unlimited privileges and white label access

## System Architecture
The platform is built on a modern stack for scalability, security, and maintainability, featuring a strong multi-tenant architecture with strict data isolation per organization (hospital, pharmacy, laboratory).

**Core Technologies:**
-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
